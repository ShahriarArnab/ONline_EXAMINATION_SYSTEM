**online-examination-system**
This project is a console-based Online Exam System written in C. It supports Teacher and Student roles, persistent storage using text files, time-based exam availability, and dynamic exam/question management.

The system is designed for academic/demo purposes and demonstrates file handling, data persistence, structured programming, and role-based workflows in C.

Compile gcc online_exam_final_persistent_fixed.c -o exam_system RUN Compile Login Credentials (Demo) Role ID to Use Student STUDENT-ID Teacher TEACHER-ID

Username and numeric password can be any value (demo purpose)

Core Concepts

Persistent Storage using text files (questions.txt, exams.txt)

Role-Based Access (Teacher / Student)

Time-Based Exams (start time & end time)

Dynamic Question Bank

Exam Creation, Merging & Updating

Randomized Question Order during Exam Program Flow Overview Program starts

Demo data is created (if files don’t exist)

User logs in

Role-specific menu is shown

Teacher Menu

Create or Merge Exam

-Enter exam title

Enter:

Start time

End time

Duration

-System checks:

If an exam with the same title exists → merge questions

Otherwise → create a new exam

Teacher selects existing questions (by QID)

Teacher can then add new questions

New questions are:

Saved permanently to questions.txt

Automatically appended to the selected exam(s)

Exams file is rewritten to ensure consistency

✅ Students immediately see updated exams.

2️⃣ Add Question

Teacher enters:

Question text

4 options

Correct option (1–4)

Question is:

Assigned a unique QID

Saved to questions.txt

3️⃣ View Question Bank

Displays all stored questions with options and correct answer

4️⃣ View Exams Displays all exams with:

Exam ID

Title

Time window

Duration

Technical Highlights Modular design with clear separation of concerns

Safe file rewriting (no duplication bugs)

In-memory + file synchronization

Defensive input handling

Scalable limits (MAXQ, MAXEXAMS)

Intended Use

Academic projects

C programming practice

File handling demonstrations

Console application design

Notes

Time is simulated using integers

No real authentication (demo only)

Designed for clarity and learning
